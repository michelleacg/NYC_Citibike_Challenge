# NYC_Citibike_Challenge

We can see that the most trips happen by males on Thursdays around 5:00 and 6:00 in the afternoon, followed by Thursdays 8:00 in the morning. For Females the most trips happen at the same time as Males, but the amount of trips are significantly lower, as they are as low as half the trips as males.
